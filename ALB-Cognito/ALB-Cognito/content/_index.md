# Deploying a simple website with authentication function using ALB and Amazon Cognito

### Overview

 In this lab, you will practice creating a simple website with authentication (registration, login, logout) using Application Load Balancer and Amazon Cognito. Additionally, during the lab, you will also be introduced to how to transfer nameservers from domain providers to Route 53, as well as how to use AWS Certificate Manager to request an SSL certificate for your domain.
 We hope this lab will be helpful for you on your "cloud journey"!
